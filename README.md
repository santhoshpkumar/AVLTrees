# AVLTrees
AVL tree implementation in Java

There are two basic oper­a­tions, using which tree balances itself.

Left Rotation.

Right Rotation.

Then there will be four possibilities

Left-Left Case : — x is the left child of y and y is the left child of z.

Left-Right Case : — x is the right child of y and y is the left child of z.

Right-Left Case : — x is the left child of y and y is the right child of z.

Right-Right Case : — x is the right child of y and y is the right child of z.
